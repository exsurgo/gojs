    <h2>Hello World</h2>

    <p>
        The basic functionality centers around controllers, actions and routes.  GoJS automatically activates
        links and forms, and routes them to controller actions.  The default route is <b>{controller}/{action}</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user clicks the below link, the click event is intercepted by GoJS and routed to the controller action.
        So the URL <b>/message/speak</b> is matched to the default route <b>/{controller}/{action}</b>, which 
        resolves to the <b>MessageController.speak</b> action.  The "speak" action has two properties, "remote" which is the 
        remote URL to request, and "response" which is an event to handle the response.
